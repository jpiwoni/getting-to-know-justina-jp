    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Introduction</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Hello! As you can already tell, my name is Justina. I am 19 years old. My birthday is April 10th, meaning I am an Aries.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I have two siblings that are older than me, both a sister and brother. I like being the youngest because I can always go to them for help.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">My parents were both born and raised in Poland and moved here in their mid-twenties. I am most grateful to them for all of their hard work to get us to where we are now.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I do not know what I would do without my family. They mean the world to me. </p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">The rest of my family lives in Poland so it gets quite lonely here during the holidays with just the five of us. We try and visit them as much as possible, but it can get quite difficult due to school and work.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I am a Computer Science major.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier">What I Hope To Learn In This Course</h3>
    <ul style="font-family: courier;list-style-type:square">
        <li>Design a website and post it online so that it can be accessed over the Internet.</li>
        <li>Identify parts of a computer and explain how each is involved in processing a set of instructions.</li>
        <li>Write algorithms to describe how to solve a problem step-by-step.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Music has always been a big passion of mine. Whether it was simply listening to it or making music myself, it always brought a smile to my face.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I love to play on various types on instruments. Some of which are guitar (acoustic or electric), drums, piano, ukulele, and even the kalimba. I plan on buying a bass soon and taking lessons at Lewis.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I love the artist Kevin Parker, who is the creator of the project Tame Impala. I look up to him and his unique talent. I was lucky enough to see him this year live, and it was a surreal experience to say the least.</p>

    <p style="font-family:courier;">Some other artists or bands I look up to include The Arctic Monkeys (seeing them on August 27th), Mac DeMarco, The Beatles, Queen, and many many more. </p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Traveling is also something that brings me a great amount of joy. Due to my family living in Poland, I always fly over there whenever I can. I have gone by myself multiple times already.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Some places I have traveled to is Poland, Hungary, Italy, France, Czech Republic, Bahamas, Belize, Honduras, Mexico, and Canada. Of course, I have also traveled around the United States. I would have to say that New York was my favorite state to visit.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Fun Fact</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier,">I would definitely say that me being vegan shocks many people. I have been vegan for a couple months,nearing to a year now. It has been something I have always wanted to do. I have been vegetarian for years prior to becoming vegan so the transition was not that hard. I care a lot about animals so refusing to eat any animal products and trying to use products that are both vegan and cruelty free are my top priority.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">The Greatest Inventions</h3>
    <ul style="font-family:courier;list-style-type:square">
        <li>First General Purpose Computer: “Analytical Engine” (1834): Who would not want to know how the first computer looked like. It is crazy to compare the first computer compared to computers now. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Analytical-Engine">More About the First General Purpose Computer</a></li>
        <li>The First Mouse (1964): When looking at the first mouse, it looks to be not functional when comparing it to the mouse today. It simply looks like a block of wood.  <a href="https://www.sri.com/hoi/computer-mouse-and-interactive-computing/">More About the First Mouse</a></li>
        <li>First Touchscreen (1965): It is interesting to see the first touchscreen when now all we really use is electronics that use touchscreen. It is nice to see where it first started.  <a href="https://www.zytronic.co.uk/insights/article/history-of-touchscreen-technology/">More About the First Touchscreen</a></li>
